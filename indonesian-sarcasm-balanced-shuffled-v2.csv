0," sesuai judul menurut kalian semua – terutama teruntuk kaum trilingual inggris  indo  satu bahasa asing bukan daerah, kapan momen kalian klik dengan bahasa asing itu hingga mampu menanggalkan bahasa awal sebagai bahasa tuntunan     pertama, saya tidak trilingual, dan momen itu ada dan tiada, saya masih kurang paham dengan ""klik"" yang dimaksud ada saat saya berinteraksi dengan orang asing, dan dia mereka mengerti, berbincang bincang tanpa ada hambatan ada juga waktu saat wawancara kerja, hal itupun terjadi ok, itu percakapan, dan saya yakin, bahkan sadar bahwa ada satu atau dua struktur yang mungkin melenceng, dan mereka tidak terganggu, apalagi mengkoreksi, dan saya memang merasakan sesuatu disitu, ada rasa puas, senang, apakah itu yang op maksud dengan ""klik"" kalau iya, saat itu adalah momen ""klik"" saya    &#x200b     apakah hipotesa saya diatas salah      untuk urusan bahasa, apalagi pembelajaran, menurut saya tidak ada yang salah hanya saja mungkin akan berbeda dengan orang lain, karena akan ada orang lain yang pasti memiliki pengalaman yang berbeda, dan akan menghasilkan hipotesa yang berbeda pula    &#x200b     menurut kalian sampai sejauh sebanyak apa koleksi kosakata supaya bisa mulai belajar grammar     kosakata dan grammar saling terkait menurut saya, tidak perlu mempunyai target untuk mempelajari mempraktekkan grammar, walaupun memiliki kosakata yang banyak tentu akan lebih menunjang saat mempelajari mempraktekkan grammar sebagai contoh, orang yang melakukan perkenalan dengan bahasa inggris, atau menjelaskan sedikit tentang dirinya dalam bahasa inggris tidak memerlukan kosakata yang banyak    my name is puki i live in underwear my father is a sailor my mother was a teacher, but she quit her job last month    tapi, dari situ akan berkembang, baik dalam kosakata karena akan ada pertanyaan dan kita akan merasa ingin untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, maupun dalam grammatical kita akan merasa ingin untuk berbicara dengan baik dan benar    jadi menurut saya, mempelajari grammar berjalan seiiring dengan penambahan kosa kata jangan mengahalangi membatasi diri untuk belajar karena sesuatu karena grammar dan kosakata, dapat kita pelajari dari mana saja    lha wong orang asli dari bahasa tertentu pun disini saya membahas bahasa inggris saja, kebanyakan tidak menguasai semua isi kamus, seperti juga kita, satu kamus kbbi pun belum tentu kita tau semua maksud dari suatu kata tertentu saya, tahu arti mengunduh dan mengunggah itu baru, daripada download dan upload    &#x200b     atau langsung terjun langsung ke grammar buku anak anak kamus bergambar kamus biasa atau langsung memakai buku berat sekelas universitas      tidak masalah semua bisa bungkus permen, kertas sisa makanan, karton penahan panas di gelas starbucks, instruksi mencuci di label baju, panduan pengguna suatu produk, yang mana yang menyenangkan, yang mana yang menggelitik rasa ingin tahu, dan rasa ingin lebih, tidak ada yang salah, kecuali kita mau belajar sat, toefl, toeic, dan semacamnya    &#x200b     adakah tips dan trik buat mereka yang pengen belajar bahasa baru sudah jelas jawabannya 'dipakai terus' tapi apa masih ada tip dan trik yang lain     dipakai terus itu punya makna dalam kenapa bisa sampai ""dipakai terus"" lingkungan sejauh ini, dan saya pernah baca satu kali ada tulisan pendek tapi kena, dan masuk akal buat saya, kurang lebih tulisan itu berbunyi, ""cara paling cepat mempelajari bahasa adalah mempelajari budayanya"" ok, pertama saya baca, yang langsung terbayang adalah budaya seperti, wayang golek, kuda lumping, tari piring, tapi bukan itu budaya culture\ nya mungkin seperti yang op bilang     atau bisa tertawa ketika ngeh lucunya jokes dalam bahasa inggris     itu karena op mengerti lawakannya joke nya karena op paham budayanya bahkan sesama orang amerika pun, belum tentu bisa mengerti punchline dari joke sesama mereka kita saja pasti dalam satu kelas, ada hal yang lucu menurut kita, tapi teman kita tidak merasa hal itu lucu, karena dia tau budaya kelompok kita, atau dia tidak mengerti akar permasalahannya, atau memang sense of humor\ nya lain    hal lain lagi, yang lahir di tahun 90 2000 an  tanpa bermaksud apa apa  , walaupun mungkin bahasa inggris diajarkan lebih dini, tapi untuk pengetahuan bahasa inggris, bisa bersaing dengan yang lahir sebelum periode itu, yang nota bene baru mendapatkan pelajaran bahasa inggris kenapa paparan logikanya, sekarang untuk belajar bahasa inggris seharusnya lebih mudah, karena paparan dari media tapi, sekarang banyak pilihan dulu, semua film, dalam bahasa inggris bahkan kartun sekarang, film kartun, yang dari luar pun, sudah pakai bahasa indonesia hp walaupun belum ada hp yang secanggih sekarang, tapi tidak akan ditemukan pilihan bahasa indonesia disitu jadi, otomatis akan memahami apa itu message, create new message, inbox, outbox, send, save, delivered, pending, dan seterusnya, dan seterusnya, you got my point, right memang, memang, hal itu tidak sepenuhnya benar, tidak sepenuhnya berlaku untuk semua orang pada jaman ini dan jaman itu     kembali ke budaya paparan budaya amerika, yang otomatis menggunakan bahasa inggris, sebegitu dashyatnya siapa dulu yang tidak hapal sweet child of mine, november rain, welcome to the jungle dari guns and roses yang tidak hapal more than words dari extreme atau nkotb dengan tonight atau a shoulder to cry on nya tommy page ok, dua terakhir itu biar adil, and to prove a point karena paparan itu dan minimnya pilihan, akhirnya, yang hidup pada jaman itu ""dipaksa"" untuk menyukai atau minimal mengetahui yang ingin tau lebih banyak ada, yang ingin taunya cukup hanya ""she got smile blablablame, remind of blablaabla, memory, where blablawas a blablablablue sky, aiiaii"", banyak yang tidak tahu artinya, lebih banyak lagi, apalagi yang paham maksudnya tapi yang ingin tahu lebih juga tidak sedikit jadi bahasa inggris itu tanpa dibikin wajib di sekolah sudah ""wajib"" duluan karena paparan budaya sekarang, walaupun paparan budaya jauh lebih massive, tapi pilihan banyak juga seperti contoh hp diatas, pilihan untuk bahasa indonesia tersedia, film kartun tidak lagi bersubtitle, tapi sudah menggunakan bahasa indonesia    jadi, budaya kita bukan hanya akan bisa, tapi akan paham contoh lagi, maaf, jadi panjang untuk yang muslim, siapa disini yang paham budaya arab bisa bahasa arab mungkin sedikit siapa yang faseh yang bisa baca al fatihah mungkin hampir semua kalau tidak semua orang muslim disini siapa yang bisa menuliskannya kembali jadi sedikit siapa yang tahu artinya siapa yang paham artinya lebih sedikit lagi siapa yang hafal doa makan siapa yang tahu artinya siapa yang bisa menuliskannya jawaban dari tiap pertanyaan itu akan berbeda beda, dan setiap orang mungki ada yang saya saya saya, ada yang saya saya saya tidak, ada yang saya saya tidak saya tidak    jadi, budaya siapa yang pernah nonton film seri f r i e n d s siapa yang ngerasa waktu pertama kali nonton ada beberapa joke yang ga dipahami, begitu nonton lagi, dan lagi, dan sekarang sekarang di tonton lagi jadi ngerti karena budaya akhirnya paham joke\ nya, walaupun udah ga ketawa    punya kenalan tki teman yang bekerja di luar negeri kapal pesiar atau jadi asisten rumah tangga di luar negeri mereka akan lebih paham atau minimal bisa menggunakan bahasa inggris atau bahasa ditempat mereka kerja jadi untuk langsung terjun dan berkecimpung pun bukan cara yang salah    satu lagi, terakhir mungkin, jangan malu, jangan takut ada beberapa yang malu berbicara, takut berbicara, keberatan untuk menanggalkan logat, padahal bisa buktinya bisa al fatihah tanpa pake logat jawa, sulawesi, sumatera, ambon, dll kenapa logatnya hilang saat membaca al fatihah, tapi untuk ngomong, ""hello, i'm puki, i would like to introduce you to my friend, nonok i like it when my friend visit me"" berlogat kental malu dan takut malu kalau salah, takut dibilang sok sok an     jadi jangan malu, jangan takut, dan jangan takut salah berbuat salahlah sebanyak banyaknya, dan perbaiki sebanyaknya that's your tips and tricks    intinya sih itu, tapi kok panjang betul ya     akhir kata, maaf, kalau ada salah salah ketik, salah salah format, ga sempet meriksa ejaan, ga sempet proof read, istri dah ngajak ke kamar, udah pake baju longgar, anak anak lagi dirumah neneknya byeee"

0,"japanese officials ignored the risks of an atomic accident because they believed in the 'myth of nuclear safety',\4\ ie the notion that severe accidents don't happen at nuclear power plants in japan\10\ ""the fundamental problem lies in the fact that utilities, including tokyo electric power tepco, and the government failed to see the danger as reality,"" the report said it also said that they were under the 'notion that severe accidents do not happen at nuclear plants in our country'\4\ ""because the government and the power utilities, including tepco, were biased by the safety myth, thinking they would never ever face such a serious accident, they were unable to realize that such a crisis could occur in reality this appears to be the fundamental problem,"" the panel said in its final report\16\ tepco thus failed to prepare adequate tsunami defenses or crisis management procedures to deal with a station blackout, the panel's report said\16\ ""the fukushima crisis occurred because people didn't take the impact of natural disasters so seriously,"" university of tokyo engineering professor yotaro hatamura, who chaired the commission, told a news conference ""even though there were new findings about the risk of a tsunami, tepco couldn't see it because people are blind to what they don't want to see""\21\nuclear regulators did not pay sufficient attention to improvements in nuclear safety standards as recommended by the international atomic energy agency iaea and the japanese nuclear industrial and safety agency had been promoting nuclear energy without being open about the inherent risks\3\ according to the report, the nuclear and industrial safety agency strongly opposed a plan in 2006 to enhance preparedness against a nuclear disaster, fearing such a move would raise concerns about the safety of nuclear power among residents living near atomic plants\17\ the failure of the central and local governments to consider the possibility of a nuclear accident caused by multiple factors such as earthquakes and tsunami also caused a delay in responding to the accident according to the report there was an insufficient crisis management structure for ensuring the safety of local communities\9\ the japanese government failed to give a detailed announcement about what was happening and how it might affect people living nearby, while the nuclear and industrial safety agency was reluctant to inform the media that reactor 1's fuel rods possibly melted, although it knew that was quite likely\16\    the panel suggested that post fukushima safety steps taken at nuclear power plants across the country have not been enough to cope with a complex catastrophe ""we understand that immediate safety measures are being further detailed and will materialise in the future but we strongly urge the people concerned to make continued efforts to take really effective steps,"" said the panel, chaired by university of tokyo engineering professor yotaro hatamura\3\ ""both the government and companies should establish a new philosophy of disaster prevention that requires safety and disaster measures against any massive accident and disaster regardless of event probability,"" the report said\3\    the report criticized tepco's argument that the nuclear accident was due to a tsunami of an unimaginable, unpredictable scale\17\ it stated, ""the reason the accident was beyond assumptions was because no attempt was made to make assumptions due to a safety myth that had no basis in fact"" the icanps panel said that there was no proof that the earthquake was a key factor in the disaster, but added that a certain degree of impact could not be ruled out\3\ many scientists and activists have disputed the japanese government and tepco's findings that the plant's cooling systems were knocked out by giant waves that slammed into the plant, suggesting it was the initial earthquake that damaged the reactors\18\ tepco's own investigation put the blame for the accident solely on the tsunami\3\ the panel, however, called on tepco to review data that had been presented to it, saying that it believed that it contained errors\3\ it also said tepco covered up unfavourable data in a computer analysis attempting to measure the extent of damage inside the reactors\7\    commission chairman yotaro hatamura said that due to time restrictions, his panel was unable to address the concerns of residents, and the international community, who questioned whether the damaged reactors and the pool of used nuclear fuel at fukushima's no4 reactor could withstand another earthquake ""i now understand what people are worried the most about is the vulnerability of the no4 spent fuel pool i wish we had started an investigation on it much earlier,"" hatamura said\21\    based on the lessons learned from the accident, the panel proposed the government and utilities take safety steps regardless of the probability of tsunami and other events that could have a potentially strong impact, and review disaster reduction measures when important new findings are revealed\17\ the final report included seven recommendations for preventing a recurrence of the fukushima nuclear accident, such as safety measures and ways to prevent the spreading of damage\9\ the panel didn't recommend charges against any of those involved in the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster,\22\ but the panel called on the government to take immediate action on certain issues, such as ensuring off site nuclear accident management centres are protected against the kind of massive radiation leaks that rendered the one at fukushima unusable\3\ it recommended that all nuclear operators in japan conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of their facilities\8\\23\ and urged the japanese government and tepco to conduct further investigations to fully disclose the cause of the fukushima daiichi nuclear disaster,\24\ because there are many unresolved issues, such as the process by which radioactive materials leaked out of the fukushima no 1 plant\9\ “the government shouldn’t close its accident investigation into fukushima with the end of probes by our committee and the parliamentary commission,” hatamura’s panel reported “when radiation levels fall, detailed on site examination inside reactor buildings, including examination of quake effects, must be carried out”\6\    fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission\edit\    on july 5, 2012, the national diet of japan fukushima nuclear accident independent investigation commission released an executive summary report\25\ of the fukushima nuclear accident the report ""blames japanese culture for the fundamental causes of the disaster""\26\\27\\28\\29\"

0,"okay, i discussed this with my friend, here's the breakdown hope this helps    how would indonesian rupiah be circulating back to indonesia if we are spending our money to buy foreign video games or non physical goods    so, 1st of all when you buy foreign games, you have to exchange the rupiah for the foreign currency thus making the rupiah weaker in comparison to the foreign currency making imports to indonesia more expensive but exports from indonesia cheaper thus reducing demand for foreign games and increasing net exports for indonesia which brings in more money and is good for the economy because it helps exporting industries make profit thus increasing employment and economic activity in other words, to buy foreign games, you have to sell your rupiah to buy foreign currency to buy foreign games it increases the supply of rupiah in the exchange market and increases the demand for the foreign currency so the rupiah loses value in comparison to the foreign currency which gains valuethe rupiah losing value can be good for exporting industries in indonesia because it makes indonesian goods cheaper especially if the foreign currency is strong which means more revenue, employment and productivity for export industries thus helping economic growth and how it circulates back is that foreigners will have to exchange their currency in foreign market for rupiah in order to buy goods plus foreigners can use the rupiah they have in reserves gained from exporting games to invest in indonesian economy if they have an economic boom thus helping indonesia's financial account    first, if we use our money to buy more efficient foreign video games, we can maximize our value per bucks and now we can focus on more productive industry    greater consumer surplus and no loss of world efficiency, eliminated dead weight loss of welfare caused by protectionism and increases and encourages competition which helps to lead to innovation, higher quality products and lower prices sometimes a company that will try to make profits is forced to create good quality products and sell at lower prices in attempt to beat his competition in a market place the good companies will make a profit and survive and the shit ones will fail    after that, rupiah that we spent would be used again by foreign governments to import stuffs from indonesia if the foreign governments don't use indonesian rupiah at all, it would actually benefit indonesians since printing money is the cheapest thing we could do    this was the simplification of his previous point and don't print money doe because it causes inflation monetary policy is only necessary during a recession where there it is highly debatable    in order to persuade foreign market to import stuffs from indonesia, indonesia have to develop a desirable product which can be argued to be quite non existent right now    which is kinda true but we are ignoring the law of comparative advantage which explains that some countries are better suited to specialization of producing certain products than others uganda has fertile soil to produce bananas while sweden doesn't in this case, uganda has comparative advantage over sweden in production of bananas but sweden in other hand has a strong knowledge economy which uganda doesn't have in these cases, its usually better to specialize in what you good at and trade with one another indonesia might not have good gaming industry but its weak currency might still help the other industries where indonesia has a comparative advantage over    if  you need to develop a desirable product, protectionism is the exact  opposite of what you want, since it by design reduces to need for local  industries to produce a product that can compete with foreign ones  although it provides a short term boost to the protected industry,  everyone is worse off long term    we also don't have quality factories here because of labor quality,  electricity, floods, and extreme red tape bureaucracy    get rid of the bureaucracy its slowing things down globalization could help indonesia, multinational companies could come to indonesia and build infrastructure and use indonesia's cheap labor to help their own business interests in doing so, multinationals will help train and educate indonesian unskilled workers, help community by giving out micro loans to start their own businesses and build some of the countries infrastructure putting the labor into use and increasing production will help stimulate indonesian economy    foreign games should be taxed heavily so people can be persuaded to buy local games    all it does is create inefficiencies and lose consumer surplus by raising prices  it also risks international retaliation, if indonesia imposes tariffs on the us, the us will retaliate with tariffs of their own thus harming indonesia    jokowi has already done many greats things like infrastructure, free training centers, promoting tourism, preventing raw material exports so foreign companies would build a factory here    at is all subjective because especially those ""free"" training centers are being paid for by taxpayers raw material exports is pretty justified because west has protectionism over developing countries as well    we also discussed comments below yours    that is if the two countries have the same added value the problem with import export is that there are winners   losers not to mention political policy        so there is protection or incentives boeing gets incentives from the american government if it can't be, it's not as competitive as that of airbus and all us airlines buying all airbus    both those companies are getting subsidized which they both shouldn't i read an article on tariffs being passed by the us on airbus due to subsidies giving unfair competition "

0,"my 0,2 kepeng    always make backup plans if you're studying in university right now, your first priority is to study your major as best as you can, but that doesn't mean that you have to abandon your hobby especially if it also has the potential to be your career whether temporary while looking for jobs, for example or permanent after you graduated     learn to write i mean like writing stories or articles for publications it doesn't have to be 'pulitzer level' writing skill, as long as they're structured and easy to understand     this is also important but not quite necessary learn other foreign languages beside english this, together with decent writing skill, will open a lot of opportunities later on    speaking about opportunities, it must be understood that they always come together with challenges i'm not trying to dampen your spirit, but the fact is the youths today will face bigger challenges in life compared to their elders when they were still young so buckle up arm yourself with as many knowledge, useful skills and connections as much as you possibly can     next, about relationship while you're still at your age, it's probably a lot harder to think and act rationally compared to adults when experiencing heartbreaks   not that adults are always rational when they're in the same situation, of course, but they usually able to take better control of their emotions so whenever it happens, just remember that it's not the end of the world pick up the pieces and move on    last but not least, i know this sounds like preaching, but as someone who has witnessed many friends destroying themselves and take others down with them    don't do drugs ever"

ketua kpi apa maksud dari anda tentang bahayanya film kartun yang notabene dinikmati oleh kalangan anak2 lalu anak2 malah dikasih konsumsi film yg benar2 tidak mendidik moral berfikir, dan etika sma sekali apa kalian cm mata duitan yg byari rattingnya tinggi,, fuck sekali kalo kalian berfikir seperti itu oke menurut saya dampak sikolog negatif oleh kartun ya malas dan mungkin masalah penayangan saja yg kurang tepat jamnya tp kslo gilm sinetron yg sama sekali gada manfaatnya brantem banyak anka kecil yg meniru oleh sinetron direspon oleh ank2 bukan film kartun kaya film apa itu manusia srigala naik haji ato apalah q tidak gemar nonton tv dan kurang suka nonton film kartun tp kasian teman2 kecil saya yg selalu dijejali film yg s      kalau kartun sebaiknya jangan di sensor masak barbie pake pakaian renang di sensor kartun yg lain juga begitu itu malah membuat anak anak semakin penasaran      kalo mau menindak harus seadil2nya jangan pilih kasih, lebih baik pilih cara voting untuk menyiarkan ato menghilangkan sebuah tayangan      kenapa acara ini harus di hentikan ini kan hanya acara hiburan untuk anak anak walaupun ini kartun tapi sayabg senang menontonnya karna acara ini mendidik tidak seperti sinetron sinetron yang d tayangkan d stasiun tv lainnya yg bagi saya itu tidak mendidik mereka hanya mengajarkan untuk pacaran pacaran dan pacaran saja tolong berikan alasan kenapa acara itu harus d hentikan terimakasih      kenapa anime dragonball dilarang tayangbr   kalo dilarang kenapa gak dari dulu, tahun '90an anime ini tayang dan gak ada masalah apa apa, kekerasan

mengambil jam tayang utama dan sangat tidak mendidik, sensor2 pada karton sangat lah tidak masuk akaltrimakasih      kepada kpi yang terhormat, br   br   saya andri ingin menyampaikan keresehan atas ketidakjelasan dan profesional kpi dalam pelarangan kartun dragon ball dimana letak bahaya kartun dragon ball kartun dragon ball sudah ada sejak tahun 96 yang mewarnai masa kecil saya, masa pertumbuhan saya, dan saya dan mayoritas anak generasi 90 saya rasa tidak ada yg bersikap kekerasan dalam seharian karena kartun tsb kalau pun kpi beralasan demikian, mengapa sinetron ggs, 7 harimau, yg action bertarung, cinta cintaan, kemewahan dan fiktif pd jam sore tdk dilarang lalu kartun naruto diizinkan apa bedanya  mohon bersifat bijak, jangan rampas keindahan imajinasi anak kecil saat ini dgn sinetron tak bermutu"

0,"sepertinya tidak dlm islam dan kalaupun ada gay agamanya islam maka segeralah bertaubat, di al quran udh jelas diceritakan kisah kaum nabi luth gw kasih sedikit bacaan, mohon sempatkan benerapa menit dan dgn hati yg lapang bkn bermaksud menghakimi, mohon maaf apabila menyinggung perasaan,     diskusi tentang lgbt lesbian, gay, biseksual, transgender kembali hangat seiring kontroversi legalisasi lgbt di indonesia yang berpenduduk mayoritas muslim pro kontra sudah pasti mengiringi isu lgbt secara garis besar, kubu yang pro lgbt mendasarkan pendapatnya pada hak asasi manusia sedangkan kubu yang kontra lgbt mendasarkan pendapatnya pada nilai nilai normatif, terutama norma agama         bagi umat muslim, tidak bisa tidak, ketika mendiskusikan isu lgbt, selalu terngiang perilaku kaum nabi luth as yang dikenal sebagai kaum penyuka sesama jenis homoseksual tulisan ini sekedar berbagi informasi tentang lgbt dari perspektif normatif alquran dan yudikatif fikih          dari 27 ayat yang memuat redaksi luth, terdapat tiga ayat yang melabeli perilaku kaum nabi luth as sebagai fahisyah, yaitu surat al a’raf 7 80, al naml 27 54 dan al ‘ankabut 29 28     ""kami juga telah mengutus luth kepada kaumnya ingatlah ketika dia berkata kepada mereka “mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah itu, yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun di dunia ini sebelummu” qs al a’raf 7 80    ""dan ingatlah kisah luth, ketika dia berkata kepada kaumnya “mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah itu, sedang kamu memperlihatkannya” qs al naml 27 54    ""dan ingatlah ketika luth berkata pepada kaumnya “sesungguhnya kamu benar benar mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun dari umat umat sebelum kamu” qs al ‘ankabut 29 28        secara bahasa, ibn faris menyimpulkan bahwa pola kata fa’ ha’ syin menunjukkan sesuatu yang buruk, keji dan dibenci sedangkan al ashfahani mengartikan fahisyah sebagai perbuatan atau perkataan yang sangat buruk         kata fahisyah disebutkan sebanyak 13 kali dalam al qur’an dalam beragam makna pertama, perbuatan zina qs al nisa’ 4 15, 19, 22, 25 al isra’ 17 32 al ahzab 33 30 al thalaq 65 1 kedua, dosa besar, seperti riba qs ali ‘imran 3 135, tradisi thawaf dengan telanjang bulat pada masa jahiliyah qs al a’raf 7 28, menyebar desas desus tentang kasus perzinahan qs al nur 24 19 ketiga, homoseksual qs al a’raf 7 80, al naml 27 54, al ‘ankabut 29 28         sesungguhnya penafsiran kata fahisyah sebagai homoseksual, didasarkan pada tafsir al qur’an dengan al qur’an, yaitu surat al a’raf 7 80 ditafsiri dengan ayat berikutnya, surat al a’raf 7 81    sesungguhnya kamu mendatangi lelaki untuk melepaskan nafsumu kepada mereka, bukan kepada wanita, malah kamu ini adalah kaum yang melampaui batas qs al a’raf 7 81        selain dilabeli sebagai fahisyah, perilaku kaum nabi luth as disebut sebagai “khaba’its”, bentuk jamak dari khabitsah tepatnya dalam surat al anbiya’ 21 74    dan kepada luth, kami telah berikan hikmah dan ilmu, dan telah kami selamatkan dia dari azab yang telah menimpa penduduk kota yang mengerjakan perbuatan perbuatan khabits khaba’its sesungguhnya mereka adalah kaum yang jahat lagi fasik qs al anbiya’ 21 74        secara bahasa, ibn faris menyimpulkan bahwa pola kata kha’ ba’ tsa’ adalah antonim dari kata thayyib baik bagus bersih dan sebagainya jadi, khabits berarti “buruk jelek kotor dan sebagainya sedangkan al ashfahani mengartikan kata khabits sebagai sesuatu yang dibenci, jelek dan hina, baik secara empiris maupun logis dari sini al ashfahani menyebut bahwa kata khabits dijadikan sebagai metonimi kinayah dari homoseksual         kata khaba’its hanya disebutkan dua kali dalam al qur’an pertama, surat al anbiya’ 21 74 yang berhubungan dengan perilaku homoseksual kedua, surat al a’raf 7 157 yang berhubungan dengan aneka makanan yang diharamkan, seperti babi, darah dan bangkai         simpulan dari paparan di atas adalah al qur’an melabeli homoseksual sebagai perilaku fahisyah yang berarti perbuatan keji yang tergolong dosa besar dan sebagai perilaku khabits yang berarti perbuatan hina, baik secara logis maupun empiris secara logis, homoseksual dinilai hina, karena menyalahi fitrah manusia normal yang menyukai lawan jenis secara empiris, homoseksual dinilai hina oleh mayoritas umat manusia di berbagai belahan dunia tampaknya bukan hanya islam yang mengingkarinya, melainkan seluruh agama di dunia juga mengingkari perbuatan homoseksual        dalam fikih, terdapat perbedaan terminologi dan konsekuensi hukum dari perbuatan asusila yang berhubungan dengan nafsu kelamin         wahbah al zuhaili dalam al fiqh al islami wa adillatuhu mengidentifikasi tiga istilah yang relevan dengan topik lgbt, yaitu zina, liwath dan sihaq berikut uraian detailnya        pertama, zina yaitu hubungan asusila antara laki laki dengan wanita yang bukan pasangan suami istri sah bagi pelaku zina yang belum menikah ghairu muhshan, hukumannya adalah dipukul dera sebanyak 100 kali, tanpa perlu dikasihani qs al nur 24 2 bagi pelaku zina yang sudah menikah muhshan, hukumannya adalah dihukum mati dengan cara dirajam atau dilempari batu dan sejenisnya         kedua, liwath gay yaitu hubungan homoseksual antara laki laki dengan laki laki statusnya jauh lebih buruk dibandingkan zina salah satu alasannya adalah allah swt menimpakan azab kepada kaum nabi luth as, dengan azab yang tidak pernah ditimpakan kepada siapapun sebelumnya    maka tatkala datang azab kami, kami jadikan negeri kaum luth itu yang di atas ke bawah kami balikkan, dan kami hujani mereka dengan batu dari tanah yang terbakar dengan bertubi tubi qs hud 11 82    azab berupa bumi yang terbalik, seolah mengisyaratkan bahwa perilaku kaum nabi luth as memang “terbalik” dibandingkan perilaku manusia normal pada umumnya         ada dua pendapat terkait hukuman gay liwath menurut imam maliki, syafi’i dan hambali hukumannya sama dengan zina lalu dipilah lagi, imam maliki dan hambali  berpendapat bahwa hukuman liwath adalah hukuman mati, baik pelakunya berstatus muhshan maupun ghairu muhshan menurut imam syafi’i, disamakan dengan hukuman pezina, yaitu apabila berstatus muhshan, maka dihukum mati apabila berstatus ghairu muhshan, maka dipukul sebanyak 100 kali tanpa belas kasih          pendapat berbeda dikemukakan oleh imam hanafi yang menilai bahwa pelaku gay liwath adalah dita’zir ta’zir berarti hukuman yang didasarkan pada kebijakan hakim yang berwenang dalam kasus ini, hukuman ta’zir tidak boleh berupa hukuman mati         ketiga, sihaq lesbi yaitu hubungan homoseksual antara wanita dengan wanita rasulullah saw pernah bersabda “perilaku lesbi antar kaum wanita adalah perzinahan” hr al thabarani hukuman pelaku lesbi sihaq adalah dita’zir sesuai dengan kebijakan hakim yang berwenang        ada dua penjelasan fikih terkait transgender pertama, jika transgender dalam pengertian laki laki yang berperilaku seperti wanita waria atau sebaliknya, maka hukumnya diharamkan, berdasarkan hadis yang melarang laki laki berpenampilan seperti wanita atau sebaliknya kedua, jika transgender dikaitkan dengan operasi mengubah kelamin, dari laki laki menjadi wanita atau sebaliknya, maka hukumnya juga diharamkan, karena tergolong tabdil atau mengubah ciptaan allah swt     sumber  "

0,"technically yes, you are right a339 could do the job as well     there are advantages of garuda using a339 first, there is no need for an additional extensive re training or hiring of pilots, because any a332 3 pilots could just fly the a339 as it is the same series of planes similar cases to why b737 ng pilots can fly the b737 max     second, cheaper maintenance as garuda has the necessary tools to fix the a330 series as having different series of plane requires different maintenance    third, a339's range is sufficient enough to cover cgk lhr or cgk ams without a stopover    fourth, a 2 4 2 economy configuration on a339 can be argued as better than a 3 3 3 economy configuration found on most b788 9, and a339 could give more economy seats than b788 9    but hear me out, i think that b788 9 is better in the long run than a339    first, b788 9's composite frame comes from 2007, and a339's metal heavy frame comes from 1992 this means that b788's newer aerodynamic could save garuda on fuel cost, and fuel is one of the biggest expenses of an airline    second, b788 9's cabin width is a bit wider than a339 549m vs 526m this extra bit of space would give garuda a bit more room to experiment with their seats, especially on the premium side you can easily make a 1 2 1 f, 2 2 2 j, 2 3 2 w, and a 2 4 2 3 3 3 y premium heavy configuration and make it super comfortable a great example of this is using oman air's first class"

0,"like, when to use imbuhan men kan or men i, or how informal i can be when i speak    our language isn't too complicated, but things you mentioned here are basically the most difficult parts of the language imo it's like us non english speakers have to memorize    1 the different ways you write plural nouns some words you can just add ""s"" like cars, donuts, banks but some words use ""es"" or like zeroes, benches  2 time related grammar do, does, did, have done, had done, has done took me years to get this damn part right and even now i don't think i perfected it yet  3 pronunciation to non english speaker, learning to pronounce words like 'heart', 'hear' and 'heard' or why 'love' and 'laugh' written differently but sounds similar won't make sense the first time    basically to know how to use imbuhan men kan and men i correctly all you have to remember is who's doing it and what's being done    take example the word ""naik"" which means ""to go up""     ""budi menaiki perahu itu""   this means budi rides the boat he goes on top of the boat   ""budi menaikkan perahu itu""   this means budi lifts the boat he brings the boat to higher position    or the word ""lompat"" which means ""jump""     ""andi melompati perahu itu""   this means, andi jumps over the boat   ""andi melompatkan perahu itu""   this means, andi makes the boat jump    another example the word ""tempat"" or ""place"" but it can also means ""to stay"" when you have imbuhan in this word the imbuhan replaces a letter, watch     ""joni menempati perahu itu""   joni stays on the boat   ""joni menempatkan perahu itu""   joni places the boat this is incomplete sentence which you can end with a place the boat is being placed on    usually men i tells you the subject itself is doing an action, while men kan usually means there is something being done to an object    then when it comes to informal languages, it is like learning idioms and colloquialism in english you get better as you practice the language"

0,"i knew this girl in high school, let’s call her hm, who had a bad reputation i was never one to slut shame even before i’d ever heard the term and i didn’t really believe the stories, because if they were true, she had fucked 75 of the boys at school, half the girls, and even some of the teachers and not just had sex, but really dirty, degrading, fucked up shit that most porn stars wouldn’t do kids are fucking brutal     not that she wasn’t troubled she definitely was she was the girl who always dressed in crazy ‘trampy’ clothes she wore too much makeup she was late and absent half the time she seemed to have a new boyfriend every other week she smoked, swore at teachers, even came to school visibly drunk a couple of times i realize now that her home life must have been a wreck    frankly, she intimidated me a little, but the small handful of times we had ever talked in the years we were in school together, she was always nice to me     one day in sophomore year i had to stay late at school for some reason some project i was working on or something i was walking home past the gym and heard crying i went to investigate and found hm, smoking, bawling her eyes out i didn’t quite know what to do so i asked her if she was ok she didn’t respond so i awkwardly gave her a hug she ended up bawling on my shoulder for what seemed like forever again, i knew hm for years at school, but we weren’t exactly friends, and this was awkward as fuck for high school me     after a bit, we started talking we probably sat there for 2 hours and talked she was upset over high school bullshit, some boy she had gone out with for a couple of weeks was a dick to her and badmouthed her, again, to the popular kids she told me about how hard it was that everyone seemed to hate her, that she wasn’t a horrible person and that it wasn’t fair how she was treated she was really sad she told me about what she wanted to do with her life, she was an artist and wanted to work for disney one day, and even showed me some of her sketches she was pretty good way better than me at least i can’t remember what i told her about, stupid high school stuff probably anyway, after we talked, she gave me a long hug and thanked me for being kind to her     the next day at school, it was almost as if that conversation had never happened i think we waved hi to each other in math class or whatever, but it was kind of weird and we didn’t really talk i thought about approaching her, talking to her again, but it just never happened i’d either not have the balls to do it, or something would come up when i tried to say hi, i don’t know    kids continued to tell mean stories about her, but i’d remember that conversation we had and tell people to shut up sophomore year ended, and she wasn’t back to our school for junior year, and i thought i’d never see her again     except i did it was near the end of senior year and one of the rich ass hole kids threw a big party at his parents’ place i was never much for parties when i was in school, but i got dragged to this one and it was like out of a goddamn movie kids drinking and making out and jumping in the pool with their clothes on it was nuts     hm she just came up to me and gave me a hug we ended up getting some beer and talking she told me how much it had meant to her that i had been kind to her that day, and that the rest of the year she tried to get the courage to talk to me again and wished i had approached her she said she had had a crush on me she said she would have totally gone out with me if i had asked, and even made it clear she would have gone to bed with me     and then she kissed me, and i kissed her back one thing led to another, and we ended up going upstairs to the host’s parents’ room i don’t want to get too graphic here, but we did some crazy shit that i couldn’t believe she did things to me that i didn’t even know were possible, things that i’ve never even dared ask my wife for 25 years later and it turns out all the rumors were true she really had had sex with some huge portion of our school, and her new school, too she really had banged several of the teachers, and even the janitor we were making a lot of noise, and soon enough some other kids burst in, and about half the people at the party ended up running a train on hm    that was the craziest night of my life when it was all over, and everyone else had left, hm and i were lying there when this little kid came into the room he was this really ugly little kid, too    i asked her, “what the hell is this kid doing here”    hm said, “oh, that’s my son”    i said, “huh i didn’t know you were  jayneralkenobi 's mom”"

for this look around you, ignoramus practically every politician save for a few are lying bastards that are voted in by the people the perpetuity of this vicious cycle has been going on ever since socrates warned about democracy, which is well over 2000 years ago         yes    good, i like that you're consistent    &#x200b    there goes your assumpshit    assumpshit is such a typical indonesian faux english insult that i won't even bother to mock you for it i forgive you for not speaking english well    &#x200b    give an example of an unrealistic promise that ahok had made in order to get votes    look, i get it you're heartbroken about ahok being victmised i admire ahok to and hate what they've done to him but you fail to understand that ahok is a speck of light in the darkness that it politics people like are the exception rather than the rule the world that you dream of, where politicians are all like ahok brave and honest, doesn't exist human nature is human nature, and you know that    &#x200b    if i were to lie to you to get your  money, would it be insane to call me a criminal but if i were to lie to  you to get your vote, it would be insane to call me a criminal simple  logic is really hard for you    and it seems that it's hard for you to comprehend that lots of politicians get away with lying and corruption yet can escape the law and it is also unimaginable for your amoeba brain that politicians can break campaign promises, which they do almost all the time    &#x200b    you have never taken a basic course  in law legal studies 101 my law teachetutor basically told me that  if we were to judge politicians like how we judge criminals, then most  of them are indeed guilty of crime if i sold you fake goods, that's  criminal and i could be persecuted for that but if politicians sell  fake promises, the court couldn't persecute them in fact, such cases  would be dismissed instantly because you know why immunity our law  system today is based on the english laws, which originated during the  reign of kings the kings made the laws so that the commoners can pursue  and attain justice, except against the kings    where the hell did you take your course youtube    i'm going to assume that our law system that you mentioned refers to indonesian law    no, you amoeba brain indonesian law is based on roman dutch law, which is different from english laws that are of a separate tradition called common law if you really have taken legal studies, explain to me what is the difference between common law and civil law, then we can talk    as for immunity, you're also wrong politicians can be charged for criminal offences the only ones who are immune are presidents, hence why there is a process called impeachment to remove them from office first but if they are found to be guilty of committing crimes as governor or mayor, they can be prosecuted it's why the kpk arrests so many people         a lot of people already know that  bush jr is no good but are you aware of harsh criticism against obama  coming from credible sources or do you think that everyone who disliked  obama must be a rightwing nutjob who thinks that obama is secretly a  muslim and faked his birth certificate just like you probably think  that people who didn't think highly of jokowi are all loonies who  believed that he is a chinese pki    i am aware of criticism against obama, and no, not everyone who criticises him are rightwing nutjobs, again you go with your binary thinking    again you fail to see the point that i make my thesis was that you basically criminalised every single us president because they all ""lied"" in their campaign promises one way or another if that doesn't sound ludicrous to you, then i don't know what will    &#x200b    even if we didn't fall into an economic crisis, would it be okay to have infrastructure money corrupted away    let me tell you the difference between indonesia and spain, since i lived there for many years the politicians in spain are very corrupt as well, and the corruption reaches even the royal family but guess what spain is a first world country with excellent infrastructure and an enviable quality of life excellent infrastructure in major cities and first class services    so yes, i'd like infrastructure, even if the money is corrupted i'd also like a strong law enforcement to prosecute and catch those who commit corruption so we can reduce its amount    &#x200b    that was a shit example although the  students do well in sports, he fails in maths and sciences, so he's  failing 2 courses out of 3    so this is why indonesia did bad at the pisa tests even you fail at reading comprehension read again    ""so he's failing 2 courses out of 3"" duh he's the analogy for soeharto even though he stabilised indonesia, he failed in building infrastructure, reducing corruption and many more hence he's failing many courses out of everything available hence he would not ""graduate"" as a student         soeharto might have stolen some money  and have some people killed, but since he saved an entire country from  collapse, from a strictly numerical perspective, there's more lives  saved than lost i don't understand why you don't see soeharto as doing  more good than bad after all, weren't you the one who prioritized  economic and infrastructures above human rights issues    because the number of lives isn't the only grade that matters again, refer to the report card analogy ""saving lives"" is just one grade out of all the things we can judge from his presidency as for the economy and infrastructure, he stabilised it after soekarno, kept things going for a while during the 70's and 80's, but the cracks began appearing in the 90's by then we had fallen way behind our neighbours singapore, malaysia and thailand and our economy turned out to stand on a base of sand, which quickly collapsed of course i'd rate him as a bad president    &#x200b    you are confused i'm not why should i be confused, just because you are    let's see, during the course of our previous debates you     used fancy words in foreign languages that you don't even speak to seem smarter,   never denied of being either a chauvinist or a crypto supremacist of a certain ethnicity,   failed to provide a credible source for ahok's healthcare programs,   accused me of being a psychopath when all that i've said doesn't even fall into the category of psychopathy, and you don't even have a background in a medical profession,   thought that the basis of our law system, which i assume you meant indonesian law, is english common law when in fact it isn't    tell me, who's confused"

for this look around you, ignoramus practically every politician save for a few are lying bastards that are voted in by the people the perpetuity of this vicious cycle has been going on ever since socrates warned about democracy, which is well over 2000 years ago         yes    good, i like that you're consistent    &#x200b    there goes your assumpshit    assumpshit is such a typical indonesian faux english insult that i won't even bother to mock you for it i forgive you for not speaking english well    &#x200b    give an example of an unrealistic promise that ahok had made in order to get votes    look, i get it you're heartbroken about ahok being victmised i admire ahok to and hate what they've done to him but you fail to understand that ahok is a speck of light in the darkness that it politics people like are the exception rather than the rule the world that you dream of, where politicians are all like ahok brave and honest, doesn't exist human nature is human nature, and you know that    &#x200b    if i were to lie to you to get your  money, would it be insane to call me a criminal but if i were to lie to  you to get your vote, it would be insane to call me a criminal simple  logic is really hard for you    and it seems that it's hard for you to comprehend that lots of politicians get away with lying and corruption yet can escape the law and it is also unimaginable for your amoeba brain that politicians can break campaign promises, which they do almost all the time    &#x200b    you have never taken a basic course  in law legal studies 101 my law teachetutor basically told me that  if we were to judge politicians like how we judge criminals, then most  of them are indeed guilty of crime if i sold you fake goods, that's  criminal and i could be persecuted for that but if politicians sell  fake promises, the court couldn't persecute them in fact, such cases  would be dismissed instantly because you know why immunity our law  system today is based on the english laws, which originated during the  reign of kings the kings made the laws so that the commoners can pursue  and attain justice, except against the kings    where the hell did you take your course youtube    i'm going to assume that our law system that you mentioned refers to indonesian law    no, you amoeba brain indonesian law is based on roman dutch law, which is different from english laws that are of a separate tradition called common law if you really have taken legal studies, explain to me what is the difference between common law and civil law, then we can talk    as for immunity, you're also wrong politicians can be charged for criminal offences the only ones who are immune are presidents, hence why there is a process called impeachment to remove them from office first but if they are found to be guilty of committing crimes as governor or mayor, they can be prosecuted it's why the kpk arrests so many people         a lot of people already know that  bush jr is no good but are you aware of harsh criticism against obama  coming from credible sources or do you think that everyone who disliked  obama must be a rightwing nutjob who thinks that obama is secretly a  muslim and faked his birth certificate just like you probably think  that people who didn't think highly of jokowi are all loonies who  believed that he is a chinese pki    i am aware of criticism against obama, and no, not everyone who criticises him are rightwing nutjobs, again you go with your binary thinking    again you fail to see the point that i make my thesis was that you basically criminalised every single us president because they all ""lied"" in their campaign promises one way or another if that doesn't sound ludicrous to you, then i don't know what will    &#x200b    even if we didn't fall into an economic crisis, would it be okay to have infrastructure money corrupted away    let me tell you the difference between indonesia and spain, since i lived there for many years the politicians in spain are very corrupt as well, and the corruption reaches even the royal family but guess what spain is a first world country with excellent infrastructure and an enviable quality of life excellent infrastructure in major cities and first class services    so yes, i'd like infrastructure, even if the money is corrupted i'd also like a strong law enforcement to prosecute and catch those who commit corruption so we can reduce its amount    &#x200b    that was a shit example although the  students do well in sports, he fails in maths and sciences, so he's  failing 2 courses out of 3    so this is why indonesia did bad at the pisa tests even you fail at reading comprehension read again    ""so he's failing 2 courses out of 3"" duh he's the analogy for soeharto even though he stabilised indonesia, he failed in building infrastructure, reducing corruption and many more hence he's failing many courses out of everything available hence he would not ""graduate"" as a student         soeharto might have stolen some money  and have some people killed, but since he saved an entire country from  collapse, from a strictly numerical perspective, there's more lives  saved than lost i don't understand why you don't see soeharto as doing  more good than bad after all, weren't you the one who prioritized  economic and infrastructures above human rights issues    because the number of lives isn't the only grade that matters again, refer to the report card analogy ""saving lives"" is just one grade out of all the things we can judge from his presidency as for the economy and infrastructure, he stabilised it after soekarno, kept things going for a while during the 70's and 80's, but the cracks began appearing in the 90's by then we had fallen way behind our neighbours singapore, malaysia and thailand and our economy turned out to stand on a base of sand, which quickly collapsed of course i'd rate him as a bad president    &#x200b    you are confused i'm not why should i be confused, just because you are    let's see, during the course of our previous debates you     used fancy words in foreign languages that you don't even speak to seem smarter,   never denied of being either a chauvinist or a crypto supremacist of a certain ethnicity,   failed to provide a credible source for ahok's healthcare programs,   accused me of being a psychopath when all that i've said doesn't even fall into the category of psychopathy, and you don't even have a background in a medical profession,   thought that the basis of our law system, which i assume you meant indonesian law, is english common law when in fact it isn't    tell me, who's confused"

1,"because although it can be obvious sometimes, many times sarcasm in text form is ambiguous    sarcasm irl relies heavily on the tone of the speaker, by using a 'sarcastic tone' while speaking, which is obviously is not applicable in text form hence the confusion    yea, you get it, but some sarcasm are more obvious than others that's why some put a as a replacement for sarcastic tone because sometimes you may get downvoted to hell due to people thinking you're serious, and it's not really anyone's fault    also you're comparing with a comedian doing stand up when a comedian is doing stand up, everyone who listen knows from the start that everything that they're going to hear are just jokes basically the comedian is setting the expectation    doing a ""today this happened to me"" joke in a normal conversation will not convey whether it's just a joke and you don't actually experience it, or it's a real funny incident that happen to you today, hence you'll hear people asking ""did that happen for real""    it's not stupid it's just a workaround for not having as much richness in the way to communicate in text form"

0," do you think the air force is interested f 16vs many forumers goes crazy about it yet there are no official stance from the air force regarding the vipers, should we bought more of it isn't the airframe going to go obsolete    &#x200b    they are very interested and from what i understand a lot of brass preferred the f 16v because of commonality and upgrade deals but unfortunately some people are convinced that the su 35 is a better option even though the older flankers can't operate with the navy and the western jets        both the f 16 and flanker are cold war era jets, it's not about the airframe but rather what is installed inside of the airframe the f 16v vastly outperforms the flankers 6 ways from sunday and don't let slavaboos tell you otherwise         what is the perfect balance between the law about the tot requirement and the weapon acquisitions should we sacrifice quantity and willing sellers to get techs, or should we prioritize the weapon quantity first but sacrifice tot deals        we should just get rid of that dumb law altogether in my opinion, and revise the kkip law so that pindad doesn't have a monopoly over land products we will never get the technology that we want like irst, elint, sigint, etc through tot from our current partners and the sooner we realize that fact and start developing our own the better          will f 35s ever be offered to indonesia and should tni be interested in this plane will ifx program made the ministry less interested in f 35 or more interested as f 35 and ifx could complement each other or will this idea is too expensive and unrealistic        yes they will, indonesia has been considered a potential buyer for the f 35 by lockheed martin and the us government the tni should be interested in this plane because with the right support planes it is literally the best fighter plane out there currently and would be best suited to replace the hawks and flankers south korea already plans on operating them both so i don't see why indonesia can't as well considering the kfx is more or less a cheaper and less capable f 35 the f 35's costs is projected to decrease in the next couple of years as more and more orders get fulfilled, i predict that we would get an offer from lockheed martin before 2030         is the tni or the ministry intersted to buy more mbts what is the ideal number of tanks for the tni  and how many for what models    &#x200b    yes and no, the opinion is divided i would say the tni needs about 50 100 more mbt's as spares and to place units on the rest of the islands with the exception of papua but before all that they should really upgrade the rest of the a4's to the ri along with adding more sensors and packages such as active protection systems and survivability kits the tni has a habit of buying 'toothless tigers' if you catch my drift         is there any interest in u214 submarines or more advanced models as the successor of u209 models are turkey or south korea willing to offer us their submarines with tots    &#x200b    yeah, especially because the 214's have aip's but unfortunately, i don't see it happening because ""kita hrs buat d dlm negeri jgn beli dr luar"" for political good boy points seems to have a higher priority than actually having a capable military          is turkey a reliable partner in defense industry what probably be their motivation to make us a partner for programs like mt, male drones, spaag and torpedo decoy should could we cooperate with them more    &#x200b    i generally don't like the turks, but yes they do have a competent and reliable defense industry not as much as the us, israel, or richer eu countries but definitely better than the rest of the me and asia         out of all the indonesian defense companies pindad, pt pal, and pt di and their subsidiaries, which one you thought is most accomplished competent and with the most satisfying work        pal        and that's because unlike pindad, pal has a lot of local competitors that forces them to constantly innovate and conduct r&d hence why pal and ptdi which has to compete with the foreign aviation market have more foreign orders than pindad        competition is good for business         what is your favorite indonesian defense product        honestly, probably the newer kcr boats ie the ones with saab combat management systems the concept works with indonesian geography and the littoral operations doctrine of the tni al however they should think about putting the kongsberg nsm jsm  better countermeasure systems         what are some insideless known information about indonesian defense hardware acquisition that is worth to know and could have very big impact strategically        stuff that i'm not allowed to say, but keep an eye out for the sky's          will indonesia acquire medium long range sam systems in the coming years perhaps aster 30 nt sam why there are no initiative to buy long range sam from a long time ago        part of the 2020 2024 defense plan is an army medium long range sam program contender includes the samp t, meads patriot, s 300, and the nasams 2 keep an eye for some pretty interesting developments in the near future         will indonesia be a leading defense arms producer in asean    &#x200b    if they decided to take defense seriously          thank you, and again, i'm very sorry for doing this        you're good fam, i actually prefer questions like this lmao"

0," sesuai judul menurut kalian semua – terutama teruntuk kaum trilingual inggris  indo  satu bahasa asing bukan daerah, kapan momen kalian klik dengan bahasa asing itu hingga mampu menanggalkan bahasa awal sebagai bahasa tuntunan     pertama, saya tidak trilingual, dan momen itu ada dan tiada, saya masih kurang paham dengan ""klik"" yang dimaksud ada saat saya berinteraksi dengan orang asing, dan dia mereka mengerti, berbincang bincang tanpa ada hambatan ada juga waktu saat wawancara kerja, hal itupun terjadi ok, itu percakapan, dan saya yakin, bahkan sadar bahwa ada satu atau dua struktur yang mungkin melenceng, dan mereka tidak terganggu, apalagi mengkoreksi, dan saya memang merasakan sesuatu disitu, ada rasa puas, senang, apakah itu yang op maksud dengan ""klik"" kalau iya, saat itu adalah momen ""klik"" saya    &#x200b     apakah hipotesa saya diatas salah      untuk urusan bahasa, apalagi pembelajaran, menurut saya tidak ada yang salah hanya saja mungkin akan berbeda dengan orang lain, karena akan ada orang lain yang pasti memiliki pengalaman yang berbeda, dan akan menghasilkan hipotesa yang berbeda pula    &#x200b     menurut kalian sampai sejauh sebanyak apa koleksi kosakata supaya bisa mulai belajar grammar     kosakata dan grammar saling terkait menurut saya, tidak perlu mempunyai target untuk mempelajari mempraktekkan grammar, walaupun memiliki kosakata yang banyak tentu akan lebih menunjang saat mempelajari mempraktekkan grammar sebagai contoh, orang yang melakukan perkenalan dengan bahasa inggris, atau menjelaskan sedikit tentang dirinya dalam bahasa inggris tidak memerlukan kosakata yang banyak    my name is puki i live in underwear my father is a sailor my mother was a teacher, but she quit her job last month    tapi, dari situ akan berkembang, baik dalam kosakata karena akan ada pertanyaan dan kita akan merasa ingin untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, maupun dalam grammatical kita akan merasa ingin untuk berbicara dengan baik dan benar    jadi menurut saya, mempelajari grammar berjalan seiiring dengan penambahan kosa kata jangan mengahalangi membatasi diri untuk belajar karena sesuatu karena grammar dan kosakata, dapat kita pelajari dari mana saja    lha wong orang asli dari bahasa tertentu pun disini saya membahas bahasa inggris saja, kebanyakan tidak menguasai semua isi kamus, seperti juga kita, satu kamus kbbi pun belum tentu kita tau semua maksud dari suatu kata tertentu saya, tahu arti mengunduh dan mengunggah itu baru, daripada download dan upload    &#x200b     atau langsung terjun langsung ke grammar buku anak anak kamus bergambar kamus biasa atau langsung memakai buku berat sekelas universitas      tidak masalah semua bisa bungkus permen, kertas sisa makanan, karton penahan panas di gelas starbucks, instruksi mencuci di label baju, panduan pengguna suatu produk, yang mana yang menyenangkan, yang mana yang menggelitik rasa ingin tahu, dan rasa ingin lebih, tidak ada yang salah, kecuali kita mau belajar sat, toefl, toeic, dan semacamnya    &#x200b     adakah tips dan trik buat mereka yang pengen belajar bahasa baru sudah jelas jawabannya 'dipakai terus' tapi apa masih ada tip dan trik yang lain     dipakai terus itu punya makna dalam kenapa bisa sampai ""dipakai terus"" lingkungan sejauh ini, dan saya pernah baca satu kali ada tulisan pendek tapi kena, dan masuk akal buat saya, kurang lebih tulisan itu berbunyi, ""cara paling cepat mempelajari bahasa adalah mempelajari budayanya"" ok, pertama saya baca, yang langsung terbayang adalah budaya seperti, wayang golek, kuda lumping, tari piring, tapi bukan itu budaya culture\ nya mungkin seperti yang op bilang     atau bisa tertawa ketika ngeh lucunya jokes dalam bahasa inggris     itu karena op mengerti lawakannya joke nya karena op paham budayanya bahkan sesama orang amerika pun, belum tentu bisa mengerti punchline dari joke sesama mereka kita saja pasti dalam satu kelas, ada hal yang lucu menurut kita, tapi teman kita tidak merasa hal itu lucu, karena dia tau budaya kelompok kita, atau dia tidak mengerti akar permasalahannya, atau memang sense of humor\ nya lain    hal lain lagi, yang lahir di tahun 90 2000 an  tanpa bermaksud apa apa  , walaupun mungkin bahasa inggris diajarkan lebih dini, tapi untuk pengetahuan bahasa inggris, bisa bersaing dengan yang lahir sebelum periode itu, yang nota bene baru mendapatkan pelajaran bahasa inggris kenapa paparan logikanya, sekarang untuk belajar bahasa inggris seharusnya lebih mudah, karena paparan dari media tapi, sekarang banyak pilihan dulu, semua film, dalam bahasa inggris bahkan kartun sekarang, film kartun, yang dari luar pun, sudah pakai bahasa indonesia hp walaupun belum ada hp yang secanggih sekarang, tapi tidak akan ditemukan pilihan bahasa indonesia disitu jadi, otomatis akan memahami apa itu message, create new message, inbox, outbox, send, save, delivered, pending, dan seterusnya, dan seterusnya, you got my point, right memang, memang, hal itu tidak sepenuhnya benar, tidak sepenuhnya berlaku untuk semua orang pada jaman ini dan jaman itu     kembali ke budaya paparan budaya amerika, yang otomatis menggunakan bahasa inggris, sebegitu dashyatnya siapa dulu yang tidak hapal sweet child of mine, november rain, welcome to the jungle dari guns and roses yang tidak hapal more than words dari extreme atau nkotb dengan tonight atau a shoulder to cry on nya tommy page ok, dua terakhir itu biar adil, and to prove a point karena paparan itu dan minimnya pilihan, akhirnya, yang hidup pada jaman itu ""dipaksa"" untuk menyukai atau minimal mengetahui yang ingin tau lebih banyak ada, yang ingin taunya cukup hanya ""she got smile blablablame, remind of blablaabla, memory, where blablawas a blablablablue sky, aiiaii"", banyak yang tidak tahu artinya, lebih banyak lagi, apalagi yang paham maksudnya tapi yang ingin tahu lebih juga tidak sedikit jadi bahasa inggris itu tanpa dibikin wajib di sekolah sudah ""wajib"" duluan karena paparan budaya sekarang, walaupun paparan budaya jauh lebih massive, tapi pilihan banyak juga seperti contoh hp diatas, pilihan untuk bahasa indonesia tersedia, film kartun tidak lagi bersubtitle, tapi sudah menggunakan bahasa indonesia    jadi, budaya kita bukan hanya akan bisa, tapi akan paham contoh lagi, maaf, jadi panjang untuk yang muslim, siapa disini yang paham budaya arab bisa bahasa arab mungkin sedikit siapa yang faseh yang bisa baca al fatihah mungkin hampir semua kalau tidak semua orang muslim disini siapa yang bisa menuliskannya kembali jadi sedikit siapa yang tahu artinya siapa yang paham artinya lebih sedikit lagi siapa yang hafal doa makan siapa yang tahu artinya siapa yang bisa menuliskannya jawaban dari tiap pertanyaan itu akan berbeda beda, dan setiap orang mungki ada yang saya saya saya, ada yang saya saya saya tidak, ada yang saya saya tidak saya tidak    jadi, budaya siapa yang pernah nonton film seri f r i e n d s siapa yang ngerasa waktu pertama kali nonton ada beberapa joke yang ga dipahami, begitu nonton lagi, dan lagi, dan sekarang sekarang di tonton lagi jadi ngerti karena budaya akhirnya paham joke\ nya, walaupun udah ga ketawa    punya kenalan tki teman yang bekerja di luar negeri kapal pesiar atau jadi asisten rumah tangga di luar negeri mereka akan lebih paham atau minimal bisa menggunakan bahasa inggris atau bahasa ditempat mereka kerja jadi untuk langsung terjun dan berkecimpung pun bukan cara yang salah    satu lagi, terakhir mungkin, jangan malu, jangan takut ada beberapa yang malu berbicara, takut berbicara, keberatan untuk menanggalkan logat, padahal bisa buktinya bisa al fatihah tanpa pake logat jawa, sulawesi, sumatera, ambon, dll kenapa logatnya hilang saat membaca al fatihah, tapi untuk ngomong, ""hello, i'm puki, i would like to introduce you to my friend, nonok i like it when my friend visit me"" berlogat kental malu dan takut malu kalau salah, takut dibilang sok sok an     jadi jangan malu, jangan takut, dan jangan takut salah berbuat salahlah sebanyak banyaknya, dan perbaiki sebanyaknya that's your tips and tricks    intinya sih itu, tapi kok panjang betul ya     akhir kata, maaf, kalau ada salah salah ketik, salah salah format, ga sempet meriksa ejaan, ga sempet proof read, istri dah ngajak ke kamar, udah pake baju longgar, anak anak lagi dirumah neneknya byeee"

0," for trans sumatra or java, the difference between 160kph and 250kph assuming we installed those trains is hours    do we even have money for hsr in sumatra connecting cities in sumatra and electrifying the existing rail in java seems much more logical given money constraint and that is the next step dirjen ka is planning to take     if we have a dedicated line and cut that time to 4 or 5 hours, it'll make train much more competitive considering many people gladly spent 4 5 hours on the road for jakarta bandung what i'm trying to say here is, if we want to develop the region along the path, then it need to be viable for business use, not for mudik    i agree with that, dedicated line is one of the answer currently in java the freight train have to share line with passengers train as you said, if we want to develop region, we can start planning for transit oriented development along some train stations therefore rail companies will not rely solely on passenger ticket sales     also the rail network need to be separated because otherwise the high speed trans rail line will just bogged down when they passing through commuter rail network    traffic bogged down is not even an issue the sheer speed of high speed train is simply too much to handle for humans reaction time making it is necessary to build separate rail major railway companies with hst services made dedicated line  still some train could run up to 160 kph on shared rail but most of these express trains run on dedicated rail when approaching small stations     i think we need to just pay the full investment on building completely new railroad network instead of trying to be cheap by insisting on utilizing museum grade existing network    i dont understand, what are you referring as museum grade existing network the narrow gauge existing technology in japan would be happy to prove you wrong this is not trying to be cheap, but we have big needs not only for railway but ports, toll roads, airports the dutch first also built a standard gauge rail but they abandon it for economic reason and turned to narrow gauge by the look of it, dirjen ka seems to follow japanese model in developing train infrastructure in java and sumatra which is, in my opinion, a sensible course of action they have extensive 1067 mm rail for passenger and freight trains which spans almost to the entirety of honshu island"

0,"i'm honestly confused with your definition of sjw not trying to belittling you, but i just never step into twitter or any social media so i don't know what most indonesians interpretation of sjw my interpretation of sjw is redditus's common interpretation, which can be understood from its name social it's about difference in social status because of a certain category like sex, race, religion, etc, justice promoting said social status equality, trying to eliminate social status difference because a category, warrior the subject basically a zealot and yeah they're annoying so my stance is clear i support social justice but i don't like the warriors assholes a good analogy is sj a god religion and sjw are their fanbase    with that in mind, i find your examples are not exactly about social justice      pb djarum case it's not social justice, and i don't think kpai is being sjw here they're just being anal about rules lawyering, to borrow dnd term not to say they're not being assholes and their actions probably a net loss for indonesia, but sjw they aren't     anita sarkeesian is the only true sjw case in your examples it's about women exploitation in games, so basically she ""advocating"" for women characters to be treated with ""equal respect"" as man characters i don't agree with most of her views but you can see the social and justice factor here     phil fish i don't see why he's wrong he was asked about what he think of japanese games and he answered exactly that he should be  free to have the opinion that japanese games sucks, just like other people should be free to agree with his opinion or not i can see sjw being assholes as usual here by bringing racist card though so the core problem imo is not about social justice but sjw just making things worse as usual     vk's tweet yes she also fits the definition of sjw but i want to use this as example why you shouldn't just dismiss sjw sjw are mostly assholes the non assholes sjw usually just called ordinary human but usually they do at least have a good point vk sjw movement has valid point about unfair treatment to papuans papuans experiencing similar treatment like what native americans and aborigins have experienced at least we can appreciate she pointing out this problem, although in a bad way and imo debating about cultural appropriation is stupid    in conclusion, i would say even though sjw are being anal, look at the core problem they bring up most of the times they do have a valid point although probably being hyperbole to the max ignore the fanbase, but don't ignore the sj"

0," sesuai judul menurut kalian semua – terutama teruntuk kaum trilingual inggris  indo  satu bahasa asing bukan daerah, kapan momen kalian klik dengan bahasa asing itu hingga mampu menanggalkan bahasa awal sebagai bahasa tuntunan     pertama, saya tidak trilingual, dan momen itu ada dan tiada, saya masih kurang paham dengan ""klik"" yang dimaksud ada saat saya berinteraksi dengan orang asing, dan dia mereka mengerti, berbincang bincang tanpa ada hambatan ada juga waktu saat wawancara kerja, hal itupun terjadi ok, itu percakapan, dan saya yakin, bahkan sadar bahwa ada satu atau dua struktur yang mungkin melenceng, dan mereka tidak terganggu, apalagi mengkoreksi, dan saya memang merasakan sesuatu disitu, ada rasa puas, senang, apakah itu yang op maksud dengan ""klik"" kalau iya, saat itu adalah momen ""klik"" saya    &#x200b     apakah hipotesa saya diatas salah      untuk urusan bahasa, apalagi pembelajaran, menurut saya tidak ada yang salah hanya saja mungkin akan berbeda dengan orang lain, karena akan ada orang lain yang pasti memiliki pengalaman yang berbeda, dan akan menghasilkan hipotesa yang berbeda pula    &#x200b     menurut kalian sampai sejauh sebanyak apa koleksi kosakata supaya bisa mulai belajar grammar     kosakata dan grammar saling terkait menurut saya, tidak perlu mempunyai target untuk mempelajari mempraktekkan grammar, walaupun memiliki kosakata yang banyak tentu akan lebih menunjang saat mempelajari mempraktekkan grammar sebagai contoh, orang yang melakukan perkenalan dengan bahasa inggris, atau menjelaskan sedikit tentang dirinya dalam bahasa inggris tidak memerlukan kosakata yang banyak    my name is puki i live in underwear my father is a sailor my mother was a teacher, but she quit her job last month    tapi, dari situ akan berkembang, baik dalam kosakata karena akan ada pertanyaan dan kita akan merasa ingin untuk menjawab pertanyaan tersebut, maupun dalam grammatical kita akan merasa ingin untuk berbicara dengan baik dan benar    jadi menurut saya, mempelajari grammar berjalan seiiring dengan penambahan kosa kata jangan mengahalangi membatasi diri untuk belajar karena sesuatu karena grammar dan kosakata, dapat kita pelajari dari mana saja    lha wong orang asli dari bahasa tertentu pun disini saya membahas bahasa inggris saja, kebanyakan tidak menguasai semua isi kamus, seperti juga kita, satu kamus kbbi pun belum tentu kita tau semua maksud dari suatu kata tertentu saya, tahu arti mengunduh dan mengunggah itu baru, daripada download dan upload    &#x200b     atau langsung terjun langsung ke grammar buku anak anak kamus bergambar kamus biasa atau langsung memakai buku berat sekelas universitas      tidak masalah semua bisa bungkus permen, kertas sisa makanan, karton penahan panas di gelas starbucks, instruksi mencuci di label baju, panduan pengguna suatu produk, yang mana yang menyenangkan, yang mana yang menggelitik rasa ingin tahu, dan rasa ingin lebih, tidak ada yang salah, kecuali kita mau belajar sat, toefl, toeic, dan semacamnya    &#x200b     adakah tips dan trik buat mereka yang pengen belajar bahasa baru sudah jelas jawabannya 'dipakai terus' tapi apa masih ada tip dan trik yang lain     dipakai terus itu punya makna dalam kenapa bisa sampai ""dipakai terus"" lingkungan sejauh ini, dan saya pernah baca satu kali ada tulisan pendek tapi kena, dan masuk akal buat saya, kurang lebih tulisan itu berbunyi, ""cara paling cepat mempelajari bahasa adalah mempelajari budayanya"" ok, pertama saya baca, yang langsung terbayang adalah budaya seperti, wayang golek, kuda lumping, tari piring, tapi bukan itu budaya culture\ nya mungkin seperti yang op bilang     atau bisa tertawa ketika ngeh lucunya jokes dalam bahasa inggris     itu karena op mengerti lawakannya joke nya karena op paham budayanya bahkan sesama orang amerika pun, belum tentu bisa mengerti punchline dari joke sesama mereka kita saja pasti dalam satu kelas, ada hal yang lucu menurut kita, tapi teman kita tidak merasa hal itu lucu, karena dia tau budaya kelompok kita, atau dia tidak mengerti akar permasalahannya, atau memang sense of humor\ nya lain    hal lain lagi, yang lahir di tahun 90 2000 an  tanpa bermaksud apa apa  , walaupun mungkin bahasa inggris diajarkan lebih dini, tapi untuk pengetahuan bahasa inggris, bisa bersaing dengan yang lahir sebelum periode itu, yang nota bene baru mendapatkan pelajaran bahasa inggris kenapa paparan logikanya, sekarang untuk belajar bahasa inggris seharusnya lebih mudah, karena paparan dari media tapi, sekarang banyak pilihan dulu, semua film, dalam bahasa inggris bahkan kartun sekarang, film kartun, yang dari luar pun, sudah pakai bahasa indonesia hp walaupun belum ada hp yang secanggih sekarang, tapi tidak akan ditemukan pilihan bahasa indonesia disitu jadi, otomatis akan memahami apa itu message, create new message, inbox, outbox, send, save, delivered, pending, dan seterusnya, dan seterusnya, you got my point, right memang, memang, hal itu tidak sepenuhnya benar, tidak sepenuhnya berlaku untuk semua orang pada jaman ini dan jaman itu     kembali ke budaya paparan budaya amerika, yang otomatis menggunakan bahasa inggris, sebegitu dashyatnya siapa dulu yang tidak hapal sweet child of mine, november rain, welcome to the jungle dari guns and roses yang tidak hapal more than words dari extreme atau nkotb dengan tonight atau a shoulder to cry on nya tommy page ok, dua terakhir itu biar adil, and to prove a point karena paparan itu dan minimnya pilihan, akhirnya, yang hidup pada jaman itu ""dipaksa"" untuk menyukai atau minimal mengetahui yang ingin tau lebih banyak ada, yang ingin taunya cukup hanya ""she got smile blablablame, remind of blablaabla, memory, where blablawas a blablablablue sky, aiiaii"", banyak yang tidak tahu artinya, lebih banyak lagi, apalagi yang paham maksudnya tapi yang ingin tahu lebih juga tidak sedikit jadi bahasa inggris itu tanpa dibikin wajib di sekolah sudah ""wajib"" duluan karena paparan budaya sekarang, walaupun paparan budaya jauh lebih massive, tapi pilihan banyak juga seperti contoh hp diatas, pilihan untuk bahasa indonesia tersedia, film kartun tidak lagi bersubtitle, tapi sudah menggunakan bahasa indonesia    jadi, budaya kita bukan hanya akan bisa, tapi akan paham contoh lagi, maaf, jadi panjang untuk yang muslim, siapa disini yang paham budaya arab bisa bahasa arab mungkin sedikit siapa yang faseh yang bisa baca al fatihah mungkin hampir semua kalau tidak semua orang muslim disini siapa yang bisa menuliskannya kembali jadi sedikit siapa yang tahu artinya siapa yang paham artinya lebih sedikit lagi siapa yang hafal doa makan siapa yang tahu artinya siapa yang bisa menuliskannya jawaban dari tiap pertanyaan itu akan berbeda beda, dan setiap orang mungki ada yang saya saya saya, ada yang saya saya saya tidak, ada yang saya saya tidak saya tidak    jadi, budaya siapa yang pernah nonton film seri f r i e n d s siapa yang ngerasa waktu pertama kali nonton ada beberapa joke yang ga dipahami, begitu nonton lagi, dan lagi, dan sekarang sekarang di tonton lagi jadi ngerti karena budaya akhirnya paham joke\ nya, walaupun udah ga ketawa    punya kenalan tki teman yang bekerja di luar negeri kapal pesiar atau jadi asisten rumah tangga di luar negeri mereka akan lebih paham atau minimal bisa menggunakan bahasa inggris atau bahasa ditempat mereka kerja jadi untuk langsung terjun dan berkecimpung pun bukan cara yang salah    satu lagi, terakhir mungkin, jangan malu, jangan takut ada beberapa yang malu berbicara, takut berbicara, keberatan untuk menanggalkan logat, padahal bisa buktinya bisa al fatihah tanpa pake logat jawa, sulawesi, sumatera, ambon, dll kenapa logatnya hilang saat membaca al fatihah, tapi untuk ngomong, ""hello, i'm puki, i would like to introduce you to my friend, nonok i like it when my friend visit me"" berlogat kental malu dan takut malu kalau salah, takut dibilang sok sok an     jadi jangan malu, jangan takut, dan jangan takut salah berbuat salahlah sebanyak banyaknya, dan perbaiki sebanyaknya that's your tips and tricks    intinya sih itu, tapi kok panjang betul ya     akhir kata, maaf, kalau ada salah salah ketik, salah salah format, ga sempet meriksa ejaan, ga sempet proof read, istri dah ngajak ke kamar, udah pake baju longgar, anak anak lagi dirumah neneknya byeee"

for this look around you, ignoramus practically every politician save for a few are lying bastards that are voted in by the people the perpetuity of this vicious cycle has been going on ever since socrates warned about democracy, which is well over 2000 years ago         yes    good, i like that you're consistent    &#x200b    there goes your assumpshit    assumpshit is such a typical indonesian faux english insult that i won't even bother to mock you for it i forgive you for not speaking english well    &#x200b    give an example of an unrealistic promise that ahok had made in order to get votes    look, i get it you're heartbroken about ahok being victmised i admire ahok to and hate what they've done to him but you fail to understand that ahok is a speck of light in the darkness that it politics people like are the exception rather than the rule the world that you dream of, where politicians are all like ahok brave and honest, doesn't exist human nature is human nature, and you know that    &#x200b    if i were to lie to you to get your  money, would it be insane to call me a criminal but if i were to lie to  you to get your vote, it would be insane to call me a criminal simple  logic is really hard for you    and it seems that it's hard for you to comprehend that lots of politicians get away with lying and corruption yet can escape the law and it is also unimaginable for your amoeba brain that politicians can break campaign promises, which they do almost all the time    &#x200b    you have never taken a basic course  in law legal studies 101 my law teachetutor basically told me that  if we were to judge politicians like how we judge criminals, then most  of them are indeed guilty of crime if i sold you fake goods, that's  criminal and i could be persecuted for that but if politicians sell  fake promises, the court couldn't persecute them in fact, such cases  would be dismissed instantly because you know why immunity our law  system today is based on the english laws, which originated during the  reign of kings the kings made the laws so that the commoners can pursue  and attain justice, except against the kings    where the hell did you take your course youtube    i'm going to assume that our law system that you mentioned refers to indonesian law    no, you amoeba brain indonesian law is based on roman dutch law, which is different from english laws that are of a separate tradition called common law if you really have taken legal studies, explain to me what is the difference between common law and civil law, then we can talk    as for immunity, you're also wrong politicians can be charged for criminal offences the only ones who are immune are presidents, hence why there is a process called impeachment to remove them from office first but if they are found to be guilty of committing crimes as governor or mayor, they can be prosecuted it's why the kpk arrests so many people         a lot of people already know that  bush jr is no good but are you aware of harsh criticism against obama  coming from credible sources or do you think that everyone who disliked  obama must be a rightwing nutjob who thinks that obama is secretly a  muslim and faked his birth certificate just like you probably think  that people who didn't think highly of jokowi are all loonies who  believed that he is a chinese pki    i am aware of criticism against obama, and no, not everyone who criticises him are rightwing nutjobs, again you go with your binary thinking    again you fail to see the point that i make my thesis was that you basically criminalised every single us president because they all ""lied"" in their campaign promises one way or another if that doesn't sound ludicrous to you, then i don't know what will    &#x200b    even if we didn't fall into an economic crisis, would it be okay to have infrastructure money corrupted away    let me tell you the difference between indonesia and spain, since i lived there for many years the politicians in spain are very corrupt as well, and the corruption reaches even the royal family but guess what spain is a first world country with excellent infrastructure and an enviable quality of life excellent infrastructure in major cities and first class services    so yes, i'd like infrastructure, even if the money is corrupted i'd also like a strong law enforcement to prosecute and catch those who commit corruption so we can reduce its amount    &#x200b    that was a shit example although the  students do well in sports, he fails in maths and sciences, so he's  failing 2 courses out of 3    so this is why indonesia did bad at the pisa tests even you fail at reading comprehension read again    ""so he's failing 2 courses out of 3"" duh he's the analogy for soeharto even though he stabilised indonesia, he failed in building infrastructure, reducing corruption and many more hence he's failing many courses out of everything available hence he would not ""graduate"" as a student         soeharto might have stolen some money  and have some people killed, but since he saved an entire country from  collapse, from a strictly numerical perspective, there's more lives  saved than lost i don't understand why you don't see soeharto as doing  more good than bad after all, weren't you the one who prioritized  economic and infrastructures above human rights issues    because the number of lives isn't the only grade that matters again, refer to the report card analogy ""saving lives"" is just one grade out of all the things we can judge from his presidency as for the economy and infrastructure, he stabilised it after soekarno, kept things going for a while during the 70's and 80's, but the cracks began appearing in the 90's by then we had fallen way behind our neighbours singapore, malaysia and thailand and our economy turned out to stand on a base of sand, which quickly collapsed of course i'd rate him as a bad president    &#x200b    you are confused i'm not why should i be confused, just because you are    let's see, during the course of our previous debates you     used fancy words in foreign languages that you don't even speak to seem smarter,   never denied of being either a chauvinist or a crypto supremacist of a certain ethnicity,   failed to provide a credible source for ahok's healthcare programs,   accused me of being a psychopath when all that i've said doesn't even fall into the category of psychopathy, and you don't even have a background in a medical profession,   thought that the basis of our law system, which i assume you meant indonesian law, is english common law when in fact it isn't    tell me, who's confused"

0," for trans sumatra or java, the difference between 160kph and 250kph assuming we installed those trains is hours    do we even have money for hsr in sumatra connecting cities in sumatra and electrifying the existing rail in java seems much more logical given money constraint and that is the next step dirjen ka is planning to take     if we have a dedicated line and cut that time to 4 or 5 hours, it'll make train much more competitive considering many people gladly spent 4 5 hours on the road for jakarta bandung what i'm trying to say here is, if we want to develop the region along the path, then it need to be viable for business use, not for mudik    i agree with that, dedicated line is one of the answer currently in java the freight train have to share line with passengers train as you said, if we want to develop region, we can start planning for transit oriented development along some train stations therefore rail companies will not rely solely on passenger ticket sales     also the rail network need to be separated because otherwise the high speed trans rail line will just bogged down when they passing through commuter rail network    traffic bogged down is not even an issue the sheer speed of high speed train is simply too much to handle for humans reaction time making it is necessary to build separate rail major railway companies with hst services made dedicated line  still some train could run up to 160 kph on shared rail but most of these express trains run on dedicated rail when approaching small stations     i think we need to just pay the full investment on building completely new railroad network instead of trying to be cheap by insisting on utilizing museum grade existing network    i dont understand, what are you referring as museum grade existing network the narrow gauge existing technology in japan would be happy to prove you wrong this is not trying to be cheap, but we have big needs not only for railway but ports, toll roads, airports the dutch first also built a standard gauge rail but they abandon it for economic reason and turned to narrow gauge by the look of it, dirjen ka seems to follow japanese model in developing train infrastructure in java and sumatra which is, in my opinion, a sensible course of action they have extensive 1067 mm rail for passenger and freight trains which spans almost to the entirety of honshu island"

0," in your opinion, what is the biggest misconception that both sides indonesians and east timorese have about each other for example, some die hard nationalist indonesians will insist that australia rigged the referendum in east timor independence favour     tbh i've just known the last one lots of timorese are nationalistic and really do want independence     since you've been to east timor a couple of times, what do you think about its future as a country as someone else mentioned in my previous post, east timor is very small and located in a spot that is not strategic, unlike singapore      in my opinion, it depends on its human resources if the younger generation can change the old ones in current office, and improve their education, it's not impossible     do you think that they will be able to develop their economy without indonesian or other foreign assistance    again, it's not impossible, but if they do have foreign assistance it would be faster to achieve    what is the difference between how the old generation and young generation born in 90's of east timorese think about indonesia do they hold a grudge against us for occupying them for 25 years do the young generation hate us     i think some still hold grudge against indonesia especially if they or their family members have been wronged by abri in the past, and some just decides to move on, and probably want indonesia as their ally     some younger generations based on what i've seen in social media are usually ticked by indonesians who bashes tl, but i can't say for sure whether they're just annoyed or hate indonesia"

0,"not as much as the army used to, actually although given that the total number of air force personnel in most countries are only a tiny fraction compared to the army, the percentage of communist leaning soldiers officers might be higher somewhat    but then again, on average, air force officers have higher education level than most of their peers in the army since it is a requirement for them to be able to perform complex calculations needed to operate and maintain planes as well as ability to understand english the latter is not only because most of our warplanes in the 15 years after independence were western made with manuals and instructions in english but also because english is the de facto standard language in international aviation    so from my viewpoint, it's highly doubtful if most of them were truly communists because it's simply not as easy for the idea of communism to be accepted by highly educated and somewhat western leaning officers compared to those with lower education level    now, if we talk about auri back then, the soldiers and officers of our air force were generally sukarno loyalists the officers who's gotten the short straw and were accused as communists were mostly those who went to russia for training on how to operate and maintain the warplanes and various electronics we bought from them in the early 1960's    while there were a few who refused to return to indonesia when they were recalled and chose to stay there instead, but most other did even though they realized that they will be scrutinized and will be interrogated due to power shift to suharto when they were still studying in russia it's also worth noting that omar dani, the chief of air force himself chose to return when he was still abroad singapore, iirc even though he knew what was coming for him    as a consequence, he was detained until 1995 while being vilified by suharto's cronies and denied his pension it even negatively impacted the air force as a whole so much that the strongest air force in se asia if not in the whole asia at its peak in 1962 63 changed into a mere shadow ot itself in only five years after 1966    it was only after the downfall of suharto when the affected air force officers, wrongly accused and thrown aside by suharto, dared to speak up and told the truth however, the damage has been done and remain to this day about the ""air force was full of commies"" back then"

0,"ah yes, don't worry about it people do said i'm too strict with definition lol     i meant ""so one can be unsure of, but believe the existence of other intelligent beings"", i wasn't particularly referring to you it's a question of if being agnostic is mutually exclusive to theism atheism, just to make sure you get the question right    there are theists who are unsure about their gods from my experience, they are usually not too religious in their life and almost all of them are christians they hold that it is difficult or impossible to be sure of anything beyond the basic tenets of the christian faith they believe that god exists, that jesus has a special relationship with him and is in some way divine, and that god should be worshipped this belief system has deep roots in judaism and the early days of the church    deism is also part of agnosticism    i don't think there's agnosticism in islam but i could be wrong    tldr agnosticism is not exclusive to just atheism"

0,"there are several reasons i can come up with why the psychologist did not give you a chance for you to tell your own problem first,  if you came not because you wanted to namely you were referred by other people, such as your parents, teacher, or boss, the psychologist will focus more on the referrer this is because the referred often feel that they have no problem with themselves, and are more likely to deny or deflect their problems granted, the psychologist should also hear from the referred 's side, but maybe,  at that moment, he or she was short on time    by the way, the common  procedure of psychological examination is    intake interview  clients are asked to write the outline of their problems in a form if there is an assistant, he is she will help the clients to fill the form instead the psychologist would then conduct a deeper interview based on the filled form the form might or might not be present, and the main purpose of this step is to gain more information and insight about client's initial  condition    psychological examination after understanding more about client's condition, the psychologist will then administer the appropriate psychological examination to the client, which usually includes cognitive tests, personality tests, and client condition specific tests the result of the examination will then be analyzed and the result will be treated as temporary diagnosis    psychological  anamnesis  this is where the psychologist confirms the result of clients' psychological examination it is usually done through thorough interview, either to the clients themselves or their families   teachers   bosses, etc other external conditionm such as familial condition or workplace condition might be asked during tuis step the main purpose is obtaining confirmation and validation of clients' condition    diagnosis psychologist will then decide the diagnosis of his or her client's condition by mainly refers to dsm after that, the intervention can begin    psychological intervention  the psychologist plan and carry out any systematic intervention that suits the clients ' need the intervention itself broadly consists of three types counselling,  psychotherapy, and take home assignments the main aim is to modify client's thought process and or client's behaviors    i am telling you this so that you won't be surprised if you find out that you have to repeat the same procedure when visiting your next psychologist so, yeah, administration of personality test is a part of the whole process you don't have to go through all of the processes btw, so when you said that you only  want to talk about your personal life, you are basically just seeking for the intake interview phase most psychologists cannot jump directly to the intervention without conducting relevant process it is like going to the doctor and ask ""saya sakit apa ya, dok"" but you refuse to take any futher medication, treatment, or operation from the doctor it is a perfectly acceptable decision"

di tanyangkan lagi oleh global tv, apakah benar film itu di larang untuk di tayangkan oleh kpi jikalau karena banyaknya faktor kekerasan pada film dragon ball sehingga tidak boleh di tanyangkan, kenapa film film yang lain, yang juga banyak faktor kekerasannya masih bisa tayang      film udh dari masih kecil, hari gini baru keluarain pernyataan klo dragon ball ga boleh tayang karena ada unsur kekerasanbr   dari dulu kemana aja kpigiliran film anak2 bau kencur soal percintaan ga dicabut, giliran kartun udh dari tahun jebot, malah dicabutbr   salah sasaran keleus      fuck kpi udah jelas

20 tahun kemana aja  br   apa2 dilarang, merokok disensor, senjata tajam disensor, belahan dada disensor, ntar kalau ada adegan cewe belahan dada keliatan sambil ngerokok trus sambil ngasah pisau, tv

ketua kpi apa maksud dari anda tentang bahayanya film kartun yang notabene dinikmati oleh kalangan anak2 lalu anak2 malah dikasih konsumsi film yg benar2 tidak mendidik moral berfikir, dan etika sma sekali apa kalian cm mata duitan yg byari rattingnya tinggi,, fuck sekali kalo kalian berfikir seperti itu oke menurut saya dampak sikolog negatif oleh kartun ya malas dan mungkin masalah penayangan saja yg kurang tepat jamnya tp kslo gilm sinetron yg sama sekali gada manfaatnya brantem banyak anka kecil yg meniru oleh sinetron direspon oleh ank2 bukan film kartun kaya film apa itu manusia srigala naik haji ato apalah q tidak gemar nonton tv dan kurang suka nonton film kartun tp kasian teman2 kecil saya yg selalu dijejali film yg s      kalau kartun sebaiknya jangan di sensor masak barbie pake pakaian renang di sensor kartun yg lain juga begitu itu malah membuat anak anak semakin penasaran      kalo mau menindak harus seadil2nya jangan pilih kasih, lebih baik pilih cara voting untuk menyiarkan ato menghilangkan sebuah tayangan      kenapa acara ini harus di hentikan ini kan hanya acara hiburan untuk anak anak walaupun ini kartun tapi sayabg senang menontonnya karna acara ini mendidik tidak seperti sinetron sinetron yang d tayangkan d stasiun tv lainnya yg bagi saya itu tidak mendidik mereka hanya mengajarkan untuk pacaran pacaran dan pacaran saja tolong berikan alasan kenapa acara itu harus d hentikan terimakasih      kenapa anime dragonball dilarang tayangbr   kalo dilarang kenapa gak dari dulu, tahun '90an anime ini tayang dan gak ada masalah apa apa, kekerasan bukan masalah utama di anime ini, lihat motivasi dan moral yang disampaikan dongbr   kalo mau mengeluarkan pernyataan dipikir dulu dongbr   br   apalagi kartun spongebob, sandy aja disensor, apa pengerunhnya coba bikin merangsang aja kagak pikir ulang tuhbr   br   kalo semua anime kartun untuk anak anak diblok, akan aknak sekarang suruh nonton apaan ggs naga naga indsiar sinetron percintaan

bayarannya gede ke kpiato kpi lbh suka nnton sinetron drpd kartun      kenapa dragonball diberhentikan saya tahu di film itu banyak adegan pertarungannya namun tidak akan ada seorangpun yang mau meniru itu sedangkan sinetron yang tidak mendidik tidak diberhentikan saya sebagai remaja sangat prihatin atas program kpi ini      kenapa film dragonball dihentikanpadahal itu hiburan untuk kami para anak anak yang lahir di tahun 90anmohon fikirkan lagi pakjangan hanya sinetron saja yang diperbopehkan untuk tayamgterimakasih      kenapa film kartoon dragonball di larang sedangkan film yg tidak punya nilai moral dan tidak berbobot diijinkanbr   mohon di telaah lagi      kenapa kartun dragon ball di hentikan padahal hanya kartun bukan menunjukkan kekerasan, tpi film ggs atau 7 manusia harimau dan anak jalanan yg ada beradegan kekerasan dan sex dibiarkan, ini kah republik indonesia hanya jabatan dan sekolahnya aja tinggi tapi logika gak dimaenin, liat negara jepang, mereka menonjolkan anime dan mereka tetep maju gak kayak indonesia film sinetron dibanyakin dan akhirnya pada bunting di usia muda, salam kami pecinta kartunbr   #savedragonball #saveindonesia #hilangkansinetron      kenapa kartun seperti itu malah di hapus dengan tuduhan ada unsur kekerasan padahal itu hanyalah tempat dunia anak"" untuk berimajinasi dan berfantasi sesuai dengan umur merekakenapa kaga malah sinetron abal"" yg gk di hapus dari sinetron kyak ggs dll udah merubah moral anak jadi tambah bejat g karuan pemikiran anak 80'&90'an mah beda jauh ama pola pikir anak sekarang jujur aja, gua lebih bahagia hidup tahun 90'an sampe 2009 daripada sekarang totonan semua tv cuma sinetron muak gua gan malah rugi gua beli tv kalo tontonan isi sinetron semua       kenapa kartun yg sudah sangat lama, dari saya sd sampai dewasa jarus d tegur itu action cartoon, sudah pasti banyak adegan perkelahian, saya hanya penikmat pertelevisian indonesia semata, dan menurut saya yg harus bapak ibu tegur itu sinetron yg mengambil jam tayang utama dan sangat tidak mendidik, sensor2 pada karton sangat lah tidak masuk akaltrimakasih      kepada kpi yang terhormat, br   br   saya andri ingin menyampaikan keresehan atas ketidakjelasan dan profesional kpi dalam pelarangan kartun dragon ball dimana letak bahaya kartun dragon ball kartun dragon ball sudah ada sejak tahun 96 yang mewarnai masa kecil saya, masa pertumbuhan saya, dan saya dan mayoritas anak generasi 90 saya rasa tidak ada yg bersikap kekerasan dalam seharian karena kartun tsb kalau pun kpi beralasan demikian, mengapa sinetron ggs, 7 harimau, yg action bertarung, cinta cintaan, kemewahan dan fiktif pd jam sore tdk dilarang lalu kartun naruto diizinkan apa bedanya  mohon bersifat bijak, jangan rampas keindahan imajinasi anak kecil saat ini dgn sinetron tak bermutu"

0,"sepertinya tidak dlm islam dan kalaupun ada gay agamanya islam maka segeralah bertaubat, di al quran udh jelas diceritakan kisah kaum nabi luth gw kasih sedikit bacaan, mohon sempatkan benerapa menit dan dgn hati yg lapang bkn bermaksud menghakimi, mohon maaf apabila menyinggung perasaan,     diskusi tentang lgbt lesbian, gay, biseksual, transgender kembali hangat seiring kontroversi legalisasi lgbt di indonesia yang berpenduduk mayoritas muslim pro kontra sudah pasti mengiringi isu lgbt secara garis besar, kubu yang pro lgbt mendasarkan pendapatnya pada hak asasi manusia sedangkan kubu yang kontra lgbt mendasarkan pendapatnya pada nilai nilai normatif, terutama norma agama         bagi umat muslim, tidak bisa tidak, ketika mendiskusikan isu lgbt, selalu terngiang perilaku kaum nabi luth as yang dikenal sebagai kaum penyuka sesama jenis homoseksual tulisan ini sekedar berbagi informasi tentang lgbt dari perspektif normatif alquran dan yudikatif fikih          dari 27 ayat yang memuat redaksi luth, terdapat tiga ayat yang melabeli perilaku kaum nabi luth as sebagai fahisyah, yaitu surat al a’raf 7 80, al naml 27 54 dan al ‘ankabut 29 28     ""kami juga telah mengutus luth kepada kaumnya ingatlah ketika dia berkata kepada mereka “mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah itu, yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun di dunia ini sebelummu” qs al a’raf 7 80    ""dan ingatlah kisah luth, ketika dia berkata kepada kaumnya “mengapa kamu mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah itu, sedang kamu memperlihatkannya” qs al naml 27 54    ""dan ingatlah ketika luth berkata pepada kaumnya “sesungguhnya kamu benar benar mengerjakan perbuatan fahisyah yang belum pernah dikerjakan oleh seorangpun dari umat umat sebelum kamu” qs al ‘ankabut 29 28        secara bahasa, ibn faris menyimpulkan bahwa pola kata fa’ ha’ syin menunjukkan sesuatu yang buruk, keji dan dibenci sedangkan al ashfahani mengartikan fahisyah sebagai perbuatan atau perkataan yang sangat buruk         kata fahisyah disebutkan sebanyak 13 kali dalam al qur’an dalam beragam makna pertama, perbuatan zina qs al nisa’ 4 15, 19, 22, 25 al isra’ 17 32 al ahzab 33 30 al thalaq 65 1 kedua, dosa besar, seperti riba qs ali ‘imran 3 135, tradisi thawaf dengan telanjang bulat pada masa jahiliyah qs al a’raf 7 28, menyebar desas desus tentang kasus perzinahan qs al nur 24 19 ketiga, homoseksual qs al a’raf 7 80, al naml 27 54, al ‘ankabut 29 28         sesungguhnya penafsiran kata fahisyah sebagai homoseksual, didasarkan pada tafsir al qur’an dengan al qur’an, yaitu surat al a’raf 7 80 ditafsiri dengan ayat berikutnya, surat al a’raf 7 81    sesungguhnya kamu mendatangi lelaki untuk melepaskan nafsumu kepada mereka, bukan kepada wanita, malah kamu ini adalah kaum yang melampaui batas qs al a’raf 7 81        selain dilabeli sebagai fahisyah, perilaku kaum nabi luth as disebut sebagai “khaba’its”, bentuk jamak dari khabitsah tepatnya dalam surat al anbiya’ 21 74    dan kepada luth, kami telah berikan hikmah dan ilmu, dan telah kami selamatkan dia dari azab yang telah menimpa penduduk kota yang mengerjakan perbuatan perbuatan khabits khaba’its sesungguhnya mereka adalah kaum yang jahat lagi fasik qs al anbiya’ 21 74        secara bahasa, ibn faris menyimpulkan bahwa pola kata kha’ ba’ tsa’ adalah antonim dari kata thayyib baik bagus bersih dan sebagainya jadi, khabits berarti “buruk jelek kotor dan sebagainya sedangkan al ashfahani mengartikan kata khabits sebagai sesuatu yang dibenci, jelek dan hina, baik secara empiris maupun logis dari sini al ashfahani menyebut bahwa kata khabits dijadikan sebagai metonimi kinayah dari homoseksual         kata khaba’its hanya disebutkan dua kali dalam al qur’an pertama, surat al anbiya’ 21 74 yang berhubungan dengan perilaku homoseksual kedua, surat al a’raf 7 157 yang berhubungan dengan aneka makanan yang diharamkan, seperti babi, darah dan bangkai         simpulan dari paparan di atas adalah al qur’an melabeli homoseksual sebagai perilaku fahisyah yang berarti perbuatan keji yang tergolong dosa besar dan sebagai perilaku khabits yang berarti perbuatan hina, baik secara logis maupun empiris secara logis, homoseksual dinilai hina, karena menyalahi fitrah manusia normal yang menyukai lawan jenis secara empiris, homoseksual dinilai hina oleh mayoritas umat manusia di berbagai belahan dunia tampaknya bukan hanya islam yang mengingkarinya, melainkan seluruh agama di dunia juga mengingkari perbuatan homoseksual        dalam fikih, terdapat perbedaan terminologi dan konsekuensi hukum dari perbuatan asusila yang berhubungan dengan nafsu kelamin         wahbah al zuhaili dalam al fiqh al islami wa adillatuhu mengidentifikasi tiga istilah yang relevan dengan topik lgbt, yaitu zina, liwath dan sihaq berikut uraian detailnya        pertama, zina yaitu hubungan asusila antara laki laki dengan wanita yang bukan pasangan suami istri sah bagi pelaku zina yang belum menikah ghairu muhshan, hukumannya adalah dipukul dera sebanyak 100 kali, tanpa perlu dikasihani qs al nur 24 2 bagi pelaku zina yang sudah menikah muhshan, hukumannya adalah dihukum mati dengan cara dirajam atau dilempari batu dan sejenisnya         kedua, liwath gay yaitu hubungan homoseksual antara laki laki dengan laki laki statusnya jauh lebih buruk dibandingkan zina salah satu alasannya adalah allah swt menimpakan azab kepada kaum nabi luth as, dengan azab yang tidak pernah ditimpakan kepada siapapun sebelumnya    maka tatkala datang azab kami, kami jadikan negeri kaum luth itu yang di atas ke bawah kami balikkan, dan kami hujani mereka dengan batu dari tanah yang terbakar dengan bertubi tubi qs hud 11 82    azab berupa bumi yang terbalik, seolah mengisyaratkan bahwa perilaku kaum nabi luth as memang “terbalik” dibandingkan perilaku manusia normal pada umumnya         ada dua pendapat terkait hukuman gay liwath menurut imam maliki, syafi’i dan hambali hukumannya sama dengan zina lalu dipilah lagi, imam maliki dan hambali  berpendapat bahwa hukuman liwath adalah hukuman mati, baik pelakunya berstatus muhshan maupun ghairu muhshan menurut imam syafi’i, disamakan dengan hukuman pezina, yaitu apabila berstatus muhshan, maka dihukum mati apabila berstatus ghairu muhshan, maka dipukul sebanyak 100 kali tanpa belas kasih          pendapat berbeda dikemukakan oleh imam hanafi yang menilai bahwa pelaku gay liwath adalah dita’zir ta’zir berarti hukuman yang didasarkan pada kebijakan hakim yang berwenang dalam kasus ini, hukuman ta’zir tidak boleh berupa hukuman mati         ketiga, sihaq lesbi yaitu hubungan homoseksual antara wanita dengan wanita rasulullah saw pernah bersabda “perilaku lesbi antar kaum wanita adalah perzinahan” hr al thabarani hukuman pelaku lesbi sihaq adalah dita’zir sesuai dengan kebijakan hakim yang berwenang        ada dua penjelasan fikih terkait transgender pertama, jika transgender dalam pengertian laki laki yang berperilaku seperti wanita waria atau sebaliknya, maka hukumnya diharamkan, berdasarkan hadis yang melarang laki laki berpenampilan seperti wanita atau sebaliknya kedua, jika transgender dikaitkan dengan operasi mengubah kelamin, dari laki laki menjadi wanita atau sebaliknya, maka hukumnya juga diharamkan, karena tergolong tabdil atau mengubah ciptaan allah swt     sumber  "

0,"     2 part question because some answers are pretty long     do you think the air force is interested f 16vs many forumers goes crazy about it yet there are no official stance from the air force regarding the vipers, should we bought more of it isn't the airframe going to go obsolete    they are very interested and from what i understand a lot of brass preferred the f 16v because of commonality and upgrade deals but unfortunately some people are convinced that the su 35 is a better option even though the older flankers can't operate with the navy and the western jets    both the f 16 and flanker are cold war era jets, it's not about the airframe but rather what is installed inside of the airframe the f 16v vastly outperforms the flankers 6 ways from sunday and don't let slavaboos tell you otherwise     what is the perfect balance between the law about the tot requirement and the weapon acquisitions should we sacrifice quantity and willing sellers to get techs, or should we prioritize the weapon quantity first but sacrifice tot deals    we should just get rid of that dumb law altogether in my opinion, and revise the kkip law so that pindad doesn't have a monopoly over land products we will never get the technology that we want like irst, elint, sigint, etc through tot from our current partners and the sooner we realize that fact and start developing our own the better     will f 35s ever be offered to indonesia and should tni be interested in this plane will ifx program made the ministry less interested in f 35 or more interested as f 35 and ifx could complement each other or will this idea is too expensive and unrealistic    yes they will, indonesia has been considered a potential buyer for the f 35 by lockheed martin and the us government the tni should be interested in this plane because with the right support planes it is literally the best fighter plane out there currently and would be best suited to replace the hawks and flankers south korea already plans on operating them both so i don't see why indonesia can't as well considering the kfx is more or less a cheaper and less capable f 35 the f 35's costs is projected to decrease in the next couple of years as more and more orders get fulfilled, i predict that we would get an offer from lockheed martin before 2030     is the tni or the ministry intersted to buy more mbts what is the ideal number of tanks for the tni  and how many for what models    yes and no, the opinion is divided i would say the tni needs about 50 100 more mbt's as spares and to place units on the rest of the islands with the exception of papua but before all that they should really upgrade the rest of the a4's to the ri along with adding more sensors and packages such as active protection systems and survivability kits the tni has a habit of buying 'toothless tigers' if you catch my drift     is there any interest in u214 submarines or more advanced models as the successor of u209 models are turkey or south korea willing to offer us their submarines with tots    yeah, especially because the 214's have aip's but unfortunately, i don't see it happening because ""kita hrs buat d dlm negeri jgn beli dr luar"" for political good boy points seems to have a higher priority than actually having a capable military     is turkey a reliable partner in defense industry what probably be their motivation to make us a partner for programs like mt, male drones, spaag and torpedo decoy should could we cooperate with them more    i generally don't like the turks, but yes they do have a competent and reliable defense industry not as much as the us, israel, or richer eu countries but definitely better than the rest of the me and asia     out of all the indonesian defense companies pindad, pt pal, and pt di and their subsidiaries, which one you thought is most accomplished competent and with the most satisfying work    pal    and that's because unlike pindad, pal has a lot of local competitors that forces them to constantly innovate and conduct r&d hence why pal and ptdi which has to compete with the foreign aviation market have more foreign orders than pindad    competition is good for business     what is your favorite indonesian defense product    honestly, probably the newer kcr boats ie the ones with saab combat management systems the concept works with indonesian geography and the littoral operations doctrine of the tni al however they should think about putting the kongsberg nsm jsm  better countermeasure systems     what are some insideless known information about indonesian defense hardware acquisition that is worth to know and could have very big impact strategically    stuff that i'm not allowed to say, but keep an eye out for the sky's      will indonesia acquire medium long range sam systems in the coming years perhaps aster 30 nt sam why there are no initiative to buy long range sam from a long time ago    part of the 2020 2024 defense plan is an army medium long range sam program contender includes the samp t, meads patriot, s 300, and the nasams 2 keep an eye for some pretty interesting developments in the near future     will indonesia be a leading defense arms producer in asean    if they decided to take defense seriously     thank you, and again, i'm very sorry for doing this    you're good fam, i actually prefer questions like this lmao    &#x200b"
